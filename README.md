# FACE-MASK-DETECTION-USING-DEEP LEARNING
The Face Mask Detection System is a deep learning and computer vision-based solution that detects whether individuals are wearing face masks in real-time. It uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model for mask classification and OpenCV’s Haar Cascade for face detection. The system captures webcam input, detects faces, and classifies them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask", displaying results with confidence scores. Lightweight and efficient, it is ideal for use in public spaces, workplaces, and entry checkpoints.
